<h2><a name="problem">Problem</a></h2>

<p>
  Composition of a musical piece is often a trial-and-error process, in which
  the musician writes down a series of notes on paper and tests them out on a
  musical instrument. One way to do this on a computer is to type the notes
  into a text file using a special notation and feed them to a program that
  understands this notation. This way, you can transcribe your favorite pieces
  of music or compose your own pieces, and easily exchange them among your
  friends on the web.
</p>

<p>
  <b>abc</b> is one of the languages designed for this purpose. It was
  originally intended for notating folk and traditional tunes of Western
  Europe, but it provides a sufficient set of constructs for transcribing a
  reasonably complex piece of music, such as
  <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~sla/abcmusic/sym7mov2.html">a Beethoven
  symphony</a>. Since its invention in 1980's, abc has become one of the most
  popular notations for music, with around 50,000 abc files circulating around
  the web.
</p>

<p>
  In this project, you will build an <i>abc player</i> for karaoke. Your abc
  player will play abc files while printing out associated lyrics in synchrony
  with the music. Specifically, each syllable of a song's lyric
  should be printed at the same time as it should be sung.
  You will use ANTLR to parse abc files, and the Java MIDI API
  to playback the music.  You are required to handle only a subset of the abc
  language, which we will discuss in more detail below in the
  <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/#specification">Specification</a> section. This subset is sufficient
  to play a large number of interesting tunes that are available on the web,
  but you are welcome to implement the rest of the standard, as long as your
  overall design remains clean and simple.
</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="purpose">Purpose</a></h2>

<p>
The purpose of this project is to help you gain experience with:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designing and implementing programs in the functional style (that is,
  making extensive use of functions over immutable types).</li>
  <li>Designing and implementing abstract types.</li>
  <li>Using common design patterns for constructing and traversing structures.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This project will also offer an opportunity to continue working with the
fundamentals of compilation, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expressing a language as a grammar.</li>
  <li>Converting a text to an abstract syntax tree.</li>
  <li>Using a parser generator, ANTLR, to parse a complex language.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Finally, the project will give you further practice in software engineering
fundamentals, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clarifying a problem statement.</li>
  <li>Inventing clear and simple interfaces to minimize coupling, and
  identifying and resolving undesirable dependencies.</li>
  <li>Structuring a program to make it easily testable, organizing, executing
  and evaluating test suites.</li>
  <li>Working collaboratively in a team.</li>
</ul>


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="readings">Background Reading</a></h2>

<p>
The Specification below is not meant to provide you with comprehensive
information on abc notation. Instead, you may find the following links helpful
as you work to understand the notation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://abcnotation.com/wiki/abc:standard:v2.1">abc standard v2.1</a>
      The current official standard for abc.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_notation">Wikipedia article
      on abc</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/music/abc/">John Chambers' abc
      site</a>: Another comprehensive site on abc. A great feature on this site
      is the <a href="http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/cgi/abc/tunefind">abc tune
      finder</a>, which lets you search through thousands of abc files around
      the web.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_musical_symbols">Wikipedia
      article on modern musical symbols</a>: A fairly comprehensive overview of
      the Western musical notation.</li>
</ul>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="specification">Specification</a></h2>

<p>
You are required to implement a subset of abc notation. The subset that you are
required to implement is described in a separate document:
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/abc_subset_description.html"><b>The ABC Subset for 6.005</b></a>.
Also, we are giving you a grammar in an EBNF that corresponds to the subset:
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/assignment_files/abc_subset_bnf.txt"><b>The ABC Subset Grammar for 6.005</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
As in Problem Set 2, you must create your own AST.
</p>

<p>
Note: You are NOT allowed to use any code taken from an existing abc player as
a part of your implementation in this project.
</p>

<p>
If you would like, you are welcome to go beyond this subset. However, you are
only required to implement the <b>ABC Subset for 6.005</b>.
</p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2><a name="tasks">Tasks</a></h2>

<p>
During this project, you will perform the following tasks. The
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/#deliverables">Deliverables and Grading</a> section specifies when
each component is due.

</p><ul>
  <li><b>Team Contracts</b> — Before you begin, you should write and
  agree to a team contract. Please see <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/teamcontract.html">this
  page</a> for details.
  </li>

  <li><b>Warmup</b> — There are some warmup exercises that you need to
  do, listed below.  They will help you learn about how the abc music player
  works.
  </li>

  <li><b>Design</b> — Using
  <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/assignment_files/abc_subset_bnf.txt"><b>The ABC Subset Grammar for
  6.005</b></a>, you will need to consider the datatype definitions you would
  like to use to represent the parsed input, as well as the music itself. In
  particular, you should think about what you'll need to do to transform the
  parsed input into a format that can be easily played. Your software's design
  is perhaps the most important part of the project; a good design will make it
  simpler to implement and debug your music player.
  </li>

  <li><b>Implementation</b> — Implement the project in Java. You may find
  that you want to make changes to your design. You are free to do this, but
  should record the changes so it is clear how and why you diverged from the
  original. Remember to do test-first programming.
  </li>

  <li><b>Tests</b> — Test your entire system on the staff sample files.
  Furthermore, create at least three additional abc files as tests. These
  should show that your player is able to correctly parse and play various
  musical constructs, as well as detect any semantic errors in an abc file. You
  should also have JUnit tests that test smaller components of your system
  (including, but certainly not limited to, your Lexer and Parser).
  </li>

  <li><b>Reflection</b> — Write a brief commentary saying what you
  learned from this experience. What was easy? What was hard? What was
  unexpected? Briefly evaluate your solution, pointing out its key merits and
  deficiencies. This is an individual activity.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></h2>

<p>Before you start the project, you should learn about the
<b><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/MIDI-seq-methods.html">
Java MIDI Sequencer</a></b>. It allows you to schedule a series of notes to be
played at certain time intervals.</p>

<p>
  Look at the package <tt>sound</tt> under <tt>src</tt>, and study the class
  <tt>SequencePlayer</tt> and the interface <tt>LyricListener</tt>. For this
  project, you will not need to modify these, but you should become comfortable
  with implementing <tt>LyricListener</tt> and using <tt>SequencePlayer</tt>'s
  constructor and its methods <tt>addNote</tt>, <tt>addLyricEvent</tt> and
  <tt>play</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>SequencePlayer(int beatsPerMinute, int ticksPerBeat, LyricListener
  listener)</b>: The constructor for <tt>SequencePlayer</tt> takes three
  parameters:
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      The first, <tt>beatsPerMinute</tt>, is the tempo of a musical piece. It
      is expressed in the number of beats per minute (BPM).  You should make
      sure to play a song at the speed specified in the song's ABC file.
    </li>
    <li>
      The second parameter, <tt>ticksPerBeat</tt>, corresponds to the number of
      ticks per beat. Note that ticks used by the sequencer are based on
      discrete time. Think about how large this number needs to be in order to
      play notes of different durations in an abc piece. For example, if
      <tt>ticksPerBeat</tt> had a value of 2, a note played for the duration of
      one tick would last half a beat, but you would not be able to schedule
      note lasting only a quarter of a beat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, <tt>listener</tt> should be a <tt>LyricListener</tt>.  The
      listener's <tt>processLyricEvent</tt> method will be called each time a
      lyric event occurs while playing the song.
    </li>
  </ul>
<p></p>

<p>
  <b>addNote(int note, int startTick, int numTicks)</b>: This method schedules
  a note to be played at <tt>startTick</tt> for the duration of
  <tt>numTicks</tt>. Here, a "tick" is similar to a time step. At the beginning
  of a musical piece, the global tick is initialized to 0, and as the music
  progresses through the notes, the global tick is incremented by some number.
  The first parameter <tt>note</tt> is a MIDI note value that corresponds to
  the pitch of a note. The provided class <tt>Pitch</tt> contains a number of
  useful methods for working with pitches. In particular, the method
  <tt>toMidiNote</tt> returns the MIDI note value of the particular note, and
  <tt>transpose</tt> can be used to transpose the note some number of semitones
  up or down.
</p>

<p>
  <b>addLyricEvent(String text, int tick)</b>: This method schedules a lyric
  event to be triggered at <tt>tick</tt>, and sets <tt>text</tt> as the text
  associated with that lyric event.
</p>

<p>
  <b>play()</b>: After all of the notes and lyrics have been scheduled, you can
  invoke <tt>play</tt> to tell the sequencer to begin playing the music.
</p>

<p>To implement <b>LyricListener</b> you should override its
<tt>processLyricEvent</tt> method, which is called whenever a lyric event is
reached as the <tt>SequencePlayer</tt> plays music.</p>

<p>Run the main method in <tt>SequencePlayer</tt>, which shows an
  example of using a sequencer to play up and down a C major
  scale, and uses two lyric events to display "Up!" and "Down!". In this
  example, all of the notes and lyrics have been hard-coded. In your abc
  player, you will be walking over your data structures that represent a
  musical piece and automatically scheduling notes and lyrics at appropriate
  ticks. You will also need to implement <tt>LyricListener</tt> in a different
  way in order to display lyrics correctly.
</p>

<p>We are also providing some example abc files that you can use to
  test your abc player. (These are included in the git
  repository under the folder <tt>sample_abc</tt>). They are:

  page</a> may be helpful.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Task 1</b>: Transcribe each of the following small pieces of music into an
  abc file. Name your files as <b>piece1.abc</b>, <b>piece2.abc</b> and <b>piece3.abc</b>,
  respectively, and commit them under the directory <tt>sample_abc</tt> in your
  team's git repository.

  <b>The ABC Subset for 6.005</b></a> useful here.
</p>

<p>
  <u>Piece 1</u>: A simple, 4/4 meter piece with triplets. As a starter, the
  header and the first two bars are already provided. You should complete the
  rest of the piece by transcribing the last two bars.

</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
  <u>Piece 2</u>: A more complex piece, with chords, accidentals, and rests.
  <b>Set its tempo to 200 and use a default note length of 1/4.</b> The piece
  below is only an excerpt, and the last measure is not a full measure. Pad the
  piece with enough rests to complete the measure.
  </p><pre><img src="./readme_files/piece2.png" border="1"></pre>
<p></p>

<p>
  <u>Piece 3</u>: A piece with lyrics.
  <b>Set its tempo to 100 and use a default note length of 1/8.</b>
  You should make sure to align your lyrics with music correctly using the
  symbols described in the ABC subset. If you want, you may ignore the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_%28music%29">tie</a> between the
  last two notes in the piece, as the ABC subset does not include ties.
  </p><pre><img src="./readme_files/piece3.png" border="1"></pre>
<p></p>

<br>

<p>
  <b>Task 2</b>: Write JUnit tests that play these pieces using the sequencer,
  similar to the main method in the <tt>SequencePlayer</tt> class. Store them
  in a separate class called <b><tt>SequencePlayerTest</tt></b>.  Didit cannot
  play music for you, so you'll want to tell Didit to ignore this test file.
  See <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/#testing">Automated Testing</a> for how to tell Didit to ignore
  a test file.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Hint:</b> <tt>SequencePlayer</tt> has a <tt>toString</tt> method that
  produces a string representation of all its events. If you are not confident
  in your listening skills, this might be useful if you want to compare
  sequences that sound the same.

<h2><a name="deliverables">Deliverables and Grading</a></h2>

<p>
  Note that you will be able to work on your projects in-class on October 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
</p>

<p>
  The <b><u>milestone deadline</u></b> is Monday, October 21, 2013 at 11:59pm. The deliverables are:

</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your <b><a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/teamcontract.html">Team Contract</a></b>. In your team's git repository, there is a folder called <tt>docs</tt>.
  You should place your contract in <tt>docs/team-contract.pdf</tt>.</li>
  <li>Your <b>Warmup</b> exercises. Place your pieces (<tt>piece1.abc</tt> through <tt>piece3.abc</tt>)
  in the <tt>sample_abc</tt> directory in your team's git repository. Also include your <tt>SequencePlayerTest</tt>
  class in team's your git repository.</li>
  <li>Your <b>Design</b>. Place your design in <tt>docs/design-milestone.pdf</tt> in your team's git repository.
  Your design must address, at the very least, the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Think about the datatypes your music player will require. List these datatypes, state whether
      they are mutable or immutable, and list their operations. For each operation, provide a short
      description of what it does. Also, we encourage (but do not require) you to include a dependency
      diagram.</li>
      <li>You may wish to modify the given <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/assignment_files/abc_subset_bnf.txt">grammar</a>
      we give you to make parsing input easier. This is ok, as long as it continues
      to fit the specifications. If you do wish to modify the grammar, include your modified
      grammar in your design.</li>
      <li>Describe your strategy for using ANTLR to create your AST. You should also describe how
      you will handle errors in the input file.</li>
      <li>Describe how you will take a representation of the input (e.g., your AST) and transform
      it into a format that you can cleanly play using <tt>SequencePlayer</tt>.
      </li><li>List the components of your system that you believe can and should be tested. For each of
      these components, describe your testing strategy and describe at least three specific test
      cases you plan to have.</li>
    </ul>
  </li><li>A <b>demo</b> of <i>some</i> working portion of the project that demonstrates significant effort towards understanding a critical or high-risk area of the design.  For example, you might demo your parser, showing that it can take nontrivial abc files and generate an ANTLR parse tree.  Or you might demonstrate your abstract datatypes, showing that you can construct a nontrivial piece of music and play it.  The code you are demonstrating must be pushed to your git repository.  Your demo does not need to be your final version of this code, and
  it doesn't need to handle all the required features of our ABC subset, but it should demonstrate progress.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Your team will be randomly assigned a TA who will help you with your design and ensure you're on the right
track before you implement your player. Meetings with TAs will occur on October 22, 23, and 24.
Your TA will get in touch with you to setup that meeting.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  The <b><u>final deadline</u></b> is Wednesday, October 30, 2013 at 11:59pm. The deliverables are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your <b>Revised Design</b>. As you implement your player, you will likely need to modify your
  original design. Start this revised design with a summary of what changed from your milestone
  design. Place your revised design in <tt>docs/design-revised.pdf</tt> in your team's
  git repository.</li>
  <li>Your <b>implementation</b>. All your code should be completed by this deadline!</li>
  <li>Your <b>tests</b>. As described in <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa13/projects/abcplayer/#tasks">Tasks</a>, you must write at least
  three abc files beyond the ones we give you. Your JUnit tests should also be completed by
  this deadline.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>
  The <b><u>reflections deadline</u></b> is Friday, November 1, 2013 at 11:59pm. In your reflections, you should address the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reflections on your team — How did you feel the team did? How well did your team work together? How was the coding? How did you split the work?</li>
  <li>Reflections on yourself — How do you think you did? What specific contributions did you make? How do you feel about your contributions?</li>
</ul>
<p>A Stellar assignment will be created for reflections. Please submit your reflections as a <tt>pdf</tt> to Stellar.</p>

<br>

<p>
  Other than reflections, all parts of the project should be committed in the repository you share with your
  teammates. Each commit to the repository should have a comment saying what you changed, as well as who worked on it.
  Your TA will be reviewing your git log to see individual contributions. Make sure you commit frequently!
</p>

<p>
  Grades will be allotted according to the following breakdown:
</p><ul>
<li>  Team Contract — 5%
</li><li>  Design — 25%
</li><li>  Implementation — 50%
</li><li>  Testing — 15%

  This kind of automation is very common in the world of professional software development, and is very useful for coordinating a team of developers.
  There is no ambiguity about whether the code compiles or not: if it doesn't compile on the build server, it doesn't compile.
  And there is no ambiguity about whether the tests pass: if they don't pass on the build server, they don't pass.
</p>
<p>
  For this project, Didit will run <b>your</b> tests: any JUnit tests you check in to your team's project repository will be executed and the results included in your Didit build report.
  Tests must be in the <code>src</code> directory with a name like <code><i>[something]</i>Test.java</code> or <code><i>[something]</i>Tests.java</code> for Didit to find them.
</p>
<p>
  Your tests will be run in an environment with limited permissions and resources.
  (E.g., filesystem access only to your <code>src</code> and <code>sample_abc</code> directories.)
  Any deliberate attempts to circumvent these restrictions are a violation of course policy and academic standards, and will be dealt with harshly.
  However:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you find that Didit is unable to run some of your tests but you think they are reasonable and should be supported, email the TAs and include <b>"Didit test restrictions"</b> in the subject line.
    This is only the second semester 6.005 is offering automated builds, so you might try things we didn't think of.
    Hopefully we will be able to make Didit more accommodating.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li>You are likely to have at least some tests Didit cannot run (e.g., tests which require the MIDI synthesizer).
    <i>Don't let Didit's restrictions stop you from writing such tests.</i>
    Instead, for these tests, include the Javadoc tag <b><code>@category&nbsp;no_didit</code></b> on the test class.
    <i>All tests in that file will be ignored.</i> You cannot use <b><code>@category&nbsp;no_didit</code></b> on methods — you must use it on the class.
    Here's an example:
  </li>
</ul>

<pre><b>package</b> player;
<b>import</b> org.junit.Test;
/**
 * Test some super complicated stuff.
 * <b>@category</b> no_didit
 */
<b>public</b> <b>class</b> SuperComplicatedTest {
  
    @Test <b>public</b> <b>void</b> testBWV1010() {
      // Didit will not run this test
    }
    // nor any other tests in this file
}
</pre>

<p>
  On your build results page, Didit will report which tests it attempted to run, and which tests it skipped.
  Make sure you and your teammates are running those tests manually.
</p>
<p>
  If you include no tests, Didit will count that as a pass — remember to also check whether your code compiled!
</p>

<h2><a name="hints">Hints</a></h2>

<p>
<b>Start early!</b> This project is more work than it seems.
Starting early on the project will give you more time to sort
out any issues and ask the staff questions that may arise, especially if you have trouble with transcribing music.
</p>

<p><b>Creating your ANTLR Lexer and Parser</b>: Given the grammar for abc, you
will need to build a lexer that breaks the input into tokens.  You will also
need to build a parser that groups the tokens into a valid syntactic construct.
Finally, you will need to convert the ANTLR provided AST into your own AST
using an ANTLR listener.
</p>

<p>
It is a good idea to break up a large grammar file into smaller ones.
Therefore, we encourage you to create other grammar files and import them into
your grammar file by putting an ANTLR import statement near the top of your
file. See
<a href="http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR4/Grammar+Structure">the ANTLR 4
documentation</a> to learn how to do this.
</p>

<p>We have provided you with a skeleton ABCMusic grammar file at
<tt>src/grammar/ABCMusic.g4</tt>. You may do whatever you want with this
template. Each time you update your grammar file you should compile it —
that is, tell ANTLR to process your file and automatically generate Java files
containing code for a lexer and a parser. To compile your grammar follow these
instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open up a terminal or a command prompt, and navigate to your Project 1 directory.</li>
<li>Enter this command: <code>cd src/grammar</code></li>
<li>Then this command: <code>java -jar ../../antlr.jar ABCMusic.g4</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You should not directly edit files that are generated by ANTLR using the
above command. All of the <code>.java</code> and <code>.tokens</code> files are
re-generated by ANTLR. If you want to change the behavior of your generated
lexer or parser, you should modify your grammar file then recompile, and ANTLR
will generate new <code>.java</code> files.
</p>

<p>Note: Sometimes, Eclipse will not detect changes caused by compiling
<code>ABCMusic.g4</code>. In this case, refresh the project by clicking on
the project in the package browser and pressing F5, or by right clicking on the
project and selecting Refresh. If this does not work, you may try going to
Project... Clean and cleaning your project.</p>


<p>In order to create your AST from your ANTLR parser we recommend you extend
the given <tt>ABCMusicListener.java</tt> to write your listener.</p>

<p>For more about ANTLR, see the lecture notes for the regular expressions and
grammars lecture.  The lecture notes have a walkthrough of ANTLR and pointers
to other reference material.</p>

<p>
<b>Designing datatypes</b>: For the design of your abc player, you
should think carefully about datatypes that you need to
represent the musical constructs in abc. Start with simple constructs,
such as notes and rests, and think about how you would build up on
these primitive objects to create more complex structures. How would
you represent a triplet? A chord? What does a bar consist of? How
would you represent multiple voices? Sort out answers to these
questions with your team members during the design stage.
</p>

<p>
<b>Evaluating expressions</b>: Once you parse an abc file and create
your own internal representation of the music as an abstract syntax
tree (AST), you will need to perform various computations that involve
traversing the tree, possibly multiple times.
</p>

<p>
<b>Multiple voices</b>: A particular challenge is how you will represent
multiple voices, and how you will merge them into a single sequence of midi events.
We recommend thinking about this challenge early in your design process.
</p>

<p>
<b>Use classtime wisely</b>: Lecture and recitation are being replaced with
time for team/TA meetings on October 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
You should use the time to work on the project, or meet up with your TA.</p>
